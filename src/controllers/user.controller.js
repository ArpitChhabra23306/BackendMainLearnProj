// This code defines a controller function for registering a user. It uses the `asyncHandler` utility to handle asynchronous operations and errors. When the function is called, it responds with a success message indicating that the user has been registered successfully. This is a basic implementation and can be expanded with actual registration logic, such as saving user data to a database.
